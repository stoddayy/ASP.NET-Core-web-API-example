<h2>This project is my very first dive in to building ASP.NET Core web API's, after some configuration I finally managed to get MySql to play ball on my Mac (had to download connectors etc)</h2>

<br>Returns a list of all incidents stored in the database.

<b><i>GET http://localhost:5000/api/incident/{id}</b></i>
